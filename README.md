# BattleHack 2020 Bot - ILikeBracketsOverTabs

This is the code for my battlehack 2020 bot hosted by [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org)

Clearly, you can tell I don't like tabbing in python.

My final bot is at `bots/king`. Ironically one of the weaker units in Chess compared to my past iterations in ascending order of `pawn`, `knight`, `bishop`, `rook`, and `thequeen`.
